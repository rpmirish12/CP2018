# Epsilon Photography

## Synopsis

Epsilon photography is a form of computational photography wherein multiple images are captured by varying a camera parameter such as aperture, exposure, focus, film speed, viewpoint, etc., by a small amount Îµ (hence the name) for the purpose of enhanced post-capture flexibility. (Wikipedia definition) The most critical aspect of epsilon photography is that *only one parameter changes* throughout the image sequence. 

For example, you may capture multiple images of a *stationary scene*:

  - At a specified interval between frames (e.g., a time-lapse)
  - Under different lighting conditions (e.g., flash/no-flash)
  - From different viewpoints
  - At different exposures
  - With different focal planes
  - At different apertures
  - With a *single* moving subject (e.g., stop motion with a single subject)
